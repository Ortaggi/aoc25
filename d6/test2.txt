hashmap checked for places on which I've tried to put block
when checking a single block:
new set that gets updated on turns with position and currently facing dir -> if already in, loop

where can we put stops:
- only where we walk
- only where we walk and where turning would lead us to a block
  how is "turning would lead to block" defined?
  whatever direction I'm moving in, if there is a block to my right I could place a 
  block in my current position and get there (if I've already taken a step)
